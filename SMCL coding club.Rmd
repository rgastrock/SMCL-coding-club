# Overview

In this experiment participants adapted to a 30 degree rotation, with various kinds of feedback:

1. Regular cursor feedback: "control"
2. Cursorjump feedback, where the rotation is shown at 1/3 the reach on each training trial: "cursorjump"
3. A group where both the cursor and hand were visible during training: "handview"
4. A group that was explained the rotation beforehand: "instructed"

All reaches were to targets at 45, 90, and 135 degrees.

# Data

There are several kinds of data that we could analyze:

1. training reaches
2. no-cursor reaches
3. passive localization
4. active localization

Both collected in the aligned and rotated phase of the task.

## Analysis plan

- for reaches: calculate reach deviation at some distance (1/4 of the reach)

# Reach training

1. Calculate baseline (trials 31-45: 5 reaches per target)
2. Correct rotated reaches for baseline deviations
3. Plot a learning curve

4. Fit an exponential to the learning curve
